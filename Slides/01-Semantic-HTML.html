</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Learning Objectives <!--(2 min)-->

- Describe semantic HTML
- Use Semantic HTML
- Write HTML with correct syntax
- Markup content and preserve context and meaning
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## HTML is Strucure <!--(5 min)-->

While HTML is just one piece of how websites are built, it is the _foundation_ upon which we build our websites. Without it, our websites would have no structure, or elements that we could style. Consider the following:

![html house](./images/html_house.gif)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
We construct our websites by first laying down the foundation (our HTML elements) and then providing it with aesthetics and style (CSS). You can't style a house before you have the foundation and outline of it, so let's get started on learning how to build out our HTML elements!
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Why is this important?

- Without a knowledge of how to properly use HTML, we can't build out our websites! If you want to build a custom website, or even do any customization on website builders like Squarespace or Wix, you need to know HTML
- Knowing HTML is one thing, but using it properly is another. Knowing which elements to use for which scenario not only improves your website's structure, but also improves its SEO (Search Engine Optimization). By utilizing semantic HTML, you have a better chance of drawing users to your website by improving your appearance in search results!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How do we use HTML? <!--(5 min)-->

HTML uses tags to "markup" a document. Tags describe and provide context to content. 

Below the `p`, or paragraph, tag describes the text Hello World as a paragraph. 

```html
<p>Hello World.</p>
```

The opening tag `<p>` is followed by a closing tag `</p>` which has a slash `/`.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Combining Tags

Many different tags can be combined and nested one within another. 

```html
<article>
  <h1>HTML</html>
  <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the best!</p>
</article>
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Tags cannot overlap!

Good:

```HTML
<p><abbr>HTML</abbr> is the best!</p>
```

Bad: 
```HTML
<p><abbr>HTML</p></abbr> is the best!
```

(the `</p>` closes before the inner `</abbr>`)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Combining Tags Activity <!--(15 min)-->

Translate the following tag combinations from english into HTML. When you're done, check your answers with a partner:

Imagine the following blocks of text, your job is to make them up using tags: 

Better get those flowers ASAP valentines day is around the corner!

<!-- 

<p>Better get those flowers <abbr>ASAP</abbr> <time>valentines day</time> is around the corner!</p>

 -->

1. Within a `div`, put an `h2` with the text "Hello World" and a `p` that says "Nice To Meet You"
1. Within a `p`, put an `abbr` with the text `HTML`, then within the rest of the `p`, put the text "is a hardware store"
1. Within an `article`, put a `p` with the text "do not forget the " followed by a `mark` that says "flowers ", and ending with "tonight" before closing out the `p`

<!--
Question 1:
<div>
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
    <p>Nice To Meet You</p>
</div>

Question 2:
<p><abbr>ACE</abbr> is a hardware store</p>

Question 3:
<article>
    <p>do not forget the <mark>flowers</mark> tonight </p>
</article>

## Semantic HTML <!--(15 min)-->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### What is semantic HTML?

**Semantic** (adj.): of or relating to meaning in language

To use a *word* semantically is to use a word in a way that properly aligns with its meaning.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**Semantic markup** is to use tags that properly align with the **content** the tags mark up.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Some Examples
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### "Valentines day! ♥️"

How would you mark this up?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

A time or date uses the `time` tag.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```html
<time>Valentines day! ♥️</time>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Or better
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
```html
<time datetime="2021-02-14">Valentines day! </time>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### "HTML"

How would you mark this up? (seriously)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Abbreviations and acronyms use the `abbr` tag.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```html
<abbr>HTML</abbr>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Or, better
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```html
<abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was invented by Tim Berners Lee.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### "How would you mark this up? (seriously)"

```HTML
<p>How would <em>you</em> mark this up? <strong>(seriously)</strong></p>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

`em` and `strong` are inline tags that control the voice of what you are saying.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<em>Always</em> use inline tags <strong>inside a block!</strong>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Sarcasm

What about a sarcasm tag?  
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Would this be useful? Discuss... 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

What tags would find useful for communication? Discuss... 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Some Rules
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- Pairs end with / - `<p>...</p>`
- Some tags don't have a pair - `<hr>`
- Tags can't overlap! - `<p><time>Valentines day!</time></p>`
- Attributes are name value pairs the value is always in quotes - `<img src="./picture.png">`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Activity <!--(20 min)-->

Pair up and research tags.

- nav, main
- footer, header
- h1-6, hgroup

2.

## BREAK <!--(10 min)-->

Take a ten minute break and wrap a tag around everything you see. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Lab

An HTML document is defined with a few tags. It's not a valid HTML doc without these tags! 

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>
```

The doctype is a special tag and doesn't follow the rules. It says what version/type of html you are writing. In this case it's HTML5. 

The HTML tag says that this is an HTML document and everything in this tag is part of that document. You can only have one of these and it surrounds everything. 

The head tag contains meta information, that is information about the document, that isn't part of the document itself, like the title. 

The title tag is always in the head tag and it defines the name the browser will show in Book marks, or tabs, or menus for this document. 

The body tag contains the content of the document. This everything you see in the browser window. The content of your page must go into the body tag! 

Mark up challenges 1-4 here: https://github.com/soggybag/learn-semantic-markup. Choose the bext tags to describe the content of the text in each of these documents. 

Write a description for intensive project. Include the following information: 

- When you made it and a date
- Title or name of the project
- Why you made it, what is the rationale for creating this project. What problems does it solve? 
- Short description of the process and tools used. 
- Meta info, where is it hosted, where is the code, how to get started etc. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- Markup your project description 
- Use semantic markup, use tags:
    - article
    - headings
    - Parargraphs
    - List
    - etc.

### What are learning Objectives? 

learning Objectives are the concepts and ideas that you need to know to claim mastery of a subject. When you have mastered a learning objective you will be able to explain it and put into practice. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Test your knowledge by explaining the concept to someone else. 

Some learning objects you will implement in code. 

Others learning objects are ideas that exist in the world at larger or are overaching ideas.
