# Final Project: Custom Calculator

## Description

This is an open-ended assignment for you to practice the skills we've learned so far in order to make a custom calculator application.

## Why this assignment?

This assignment will reinforce core concepts used in programming with JavaScript. You'll get a chance to practice using Flex Box, CSS styling, querySelector, and event listeners in JavaScript.

## Project requirements

Your goal is to make a calculator application to calculate a result using a custom formula. [Here](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/triangle-theorems.php) is an example of a calculator that evaluates the side lengths & angles of a triangle using mathematical theorems. Your calculator must have a theme & meaningful purpose.

Your site must have the following features:

- Include base HTML code (doctype, html, head, body tags)
- Use Flex Box for positioning the calculator elements
- CSS styles - Use at least 6 styles to make your calculator look presentable
- Uses form with at least 3 inputs
  - One of those inputs must be a [select dropdown](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)
- Uses all of the inputs to calculate the result
- Result is calculated whenever an input is modified

## Project Ideas

If you need an idea for a project, here are a few:

- **Geometric Shapes Volume Calculator** - Calculate the volume of a cone, sphere, or cylinder by inputting their dimensions! You can use the formulas [here](https://byjus.com/volume-formulas/) to get you started.
- **Trip Calculator** - How long will it take to get from a starting point to a destination, based on your mode of transportation, time of day, etc?
- **Pet Calculator** - How many cats/dogs should you own, based on things like your floor space, number of family members, & amount of free time?
- **Pokemon Calculator** - How much damage will a particular Pokemon move do, based on the Pokemon types, strength, defense, etc? If you want, check out this [Bulbapedia article](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage) on calculating damage.

## Starter Code

No starter code for this one! However, if you are having trouble getting started, we would encourage you to use your [Tip Calculator](Assignments/07-Tip-Calculator) assignment code as starter code.

### Deliverable

Push your work to a GitHub repo, and then submit the repo to Gradescope!

## Assessing the assignment

| Expectations | Does not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------------|:--------------|:------|:--------|
| Completion | Your work is not complete | Your page is complete, and meets the description of the assignment | Besides meeting requirements in the base assignment you have tackled one or more of the stratch challenges outlined in the assignment. |
| Code Quality | Your code is sloppy and lacks organization | Your code uses consistent indentation, spacing, and consistent coding style | Your code passes validation |
| Design | Your design does not inspire you | Your design inspires you | Your design inspires others |
